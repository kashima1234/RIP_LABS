This is a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) project bootstrapped with [`django-admin startproject`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/django-admin/#startproject).

Getting Started
First, set up your environment and install dependencies:

Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Django:

bash
Copy code
pip install django
Start your Django project:

bash
Copy code
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
Run the development server:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Open http://localhost:8000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the project by modifying files in the myproject folder. Django auto-reloads as you edit the files.

Learn More
----------

To learn more about Django, take a look at the following resources:

*   [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/) - learn about Django features and API.
*   Django for Beginners - a step-by-step guide to building a Django web application.

You can check out [the Django GitHub repository](https://github.com/django/django) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

Deploy on Heroku
----------------

The easiest way to deploy your Django app is to use platforms like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). You can find detailed deployment instructions for Django in the [Django Deployment documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/howto/deployment/).

What is Ngrok?
Ngrok (https://ngrok.com/) is a tool that allows you to expose a local development server to the internet by creating a secure tunnel to a specific port on your local machine. It is incredibly useful when testing webhooks, APIs, or sharing your local project with others without deploying it to a production server.

Steps to Use Ngrok to Open a Port for Your Local Site
Here’s how to use Ngrok to expose a local port (such as your Django app running on port 8000) to the internet.

1. Install Ngrok
Download Ngrok: Visit Ngrok's download page and download it for your system.
Install Ngrok:
For Linux/macOS, unzip the file and move it to /usr/local/bin:
bash
Copy code
unzip /path/to/ngrok.zip
sudo mv ./ngrok /usr/local/bin/ngrok
For Windows, extract the folder and add ngrok.exe to your PATH or run it from the command line.
2. Expose Your Local Django App
Start your Django development server:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
By default, Django runs on port 8000, so your app will be accessible at http://localhost:8000.
3. Open Ngrok and Create a Tunnel
In a new terminal window, run the following command to expose port 8000:
bash
Copy code
ngrok http 8000
This will create a public URL (something like http://abcd1234.ngrok.io) that you can share with anyone or use for testing external services, like webhooks.
4. Access the Public URL
After running the command, Ngrok will provide two URLs:
An HTTP URL (e.g., http://abcd1234.ngrok.io)
An HTTPS URL (e.g., https://abcd1234.ngrok.io)
You can now access your local Django site through the public URL provided by Ngrok.

5. Optional: Use Ngrok Auth Token
To make the tunnel more secure, you can set up an auth token in Ngrok:

Sign up for a free account on Ngrok's website.
After signing in, you’ll find your auth token under the "Your Authtoken" section.
Set the auth token by running:
bash
Copy code
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
This will enable access to more features like reserved domains and better stability for your tunnels.

Additional Ngrok Features
Port Forwarding: You can forward other services, not just web servers. For example, if you're running an API server on a different port, you can forward that port as well.
Reserved Domains: With a paid plan, Ngrok lets you reserve specific subdomains for your tunnels.

Example with Django and Ngrok
Start Django Server:

bash
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
Expose the Local Server with Ngrok:

bash
ngrok http 8000
Result: Ngrok provides URLs like:

Forwarding                    http://abcd1234.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8000
Forwarding                    https://abcd1234.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8000
You can now share https://abcd1234.ngrok.io for anyone to access your local Django app.
