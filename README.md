This is a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) project bootstrapped with [`django-admin startproject`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/django-admin/#startproject).

Getting Started
First, set up your environment and install dependencies:

Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Django:

bash
Copy code
pip install django
Start your Django project:

bash
Copy code
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
Run the development server:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Open http://localhost:8000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the project by modifying files in the myproject folder. Django auto-reloads as you edit the files.
